# fabric_engin_point_distribution
Point distribution - Taking advantage of KL language in Fabric Engine, create distribute points on a plane and use it to scatter geometry on points.

The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with Fabric Engine. 

This project attempts to achieve the following goals:(Some are still in progress)

1- Utilize KL within the Fabric Canvas application.
2- Utilize the parallel processing capabilities(PEX).
3- Gather and Randomize points from a source geometry.
4- Random percentage subtraction of points.
5- Point subtraction based a on secondary geometry.
6- Distribute based on texture map as input.
7- Deform the plane using some sort of procedural method place the points.
8- Utilize a texture map as input for how the plane is deformed.
